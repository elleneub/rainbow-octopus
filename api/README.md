# Rainbow-Octopus api

## Installation
Have the following installed in your machine:
 * Python (we are using version 3.6.9)
 * Pip version 20.0.2 (pip3)
 * Git
 * PostgreSQL or we will have an option to run PostgreSQL in the cloud (this option coming soon)


 Install virtualenv if it's not available on your machine already.

 ```
 pip3 install virtualenv
 ```

 Create a virtual environment and install all the python libraries required 
 by the project.

 ```
 virtualenv env
 ```
 
 ```
 source env/bin/activate
 ```

 ```
 pip3 install -r requirements.txt
 ```

Now you can run the app locally by running on the command line:

```
python3 app.py
```
