# Rainbow-Octopus UI

## Installing the UI

You'll need to have npm installed, we are using npm 6.14.4. If you need to install npm go to their [website](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm). Then from the command line in the ui project directory run `npm start`. This should serve the file locally, and open the app in the browser. When you save, it will recompile and update the brower.

## Extentions

We are using the prettier code formatter. To install in visual studio code activate the extension from the VSCode extension marketplace. We are not currently using a linter.

## Deploying the UI

Run `npm run-script build` to create a production build in the 'build' folder. Copy and paste the contents of this folder to the host. Elle and Megan know how to do this.
